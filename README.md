# Test suite for todo manager API Project 3

Name:Ege Odaci

## Environment Setup
> Important: need python >= 3.6 since f-strings are used
> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Ensure 'todo manager API' is running on localhost:4567
> java -jar runTodoManagerRestAPI-1.5.5.jar

## Option 1) Run all tests 
> pytest

## Option 2) To get graphs about cpu% vs instances  
>phyton graph_cpu_instance.py


## Option 3) To get cpu usage of the system vs time
>phyton graph_time_cpu.py

## Option 4) To get cpu usage of the system vs time as doing requests to API
>phyton graph_time_cpu.py
>phyton collect_cpu_data.py

To do so these two lines should be run in parallel. In other words at the same time as seperate threads or processes.
